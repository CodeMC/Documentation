This is usually only the case for organizations that have been added to CodeMC.  
Should you encounter this with an organization, head over to your [Connection Settings on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications) and make sure you granted the [CodeMC Application](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/2debe3b061b244423bf5) access to your User Account and Organization in question. This is indicated by a green checkmark next to the Organization displayed.
