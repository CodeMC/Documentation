# Are non-Minecraft projects allowed?

**Short Answer:** Yes

**Long Answer:** CodeMC accepts any Java (or Java-related) project that shows thorough quality and usefulness for the overall programming community, be it a library, software, or even a game. If you're using Kotlin or Scala, your project should compile to the JVM while continuing to provide services intended for the community.
What matters is, that the project is following our [Usage Guidelines](../usage-guidelines.md) to remain on our Services.
