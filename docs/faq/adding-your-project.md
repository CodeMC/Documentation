# How to add your project to CodeMC?

CodeMC is open for join requests, as we want to offer a free and reliable CI-Service to everyone that needs one.

In order to join will you need to join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/AGcFMu6). There, head to the `#request-access` channel and read the Pinned Message as it contains important info on what requirements you need to fulfill and how to request being added.

/// note
You are only required to make one join request with a project.  
If you are accepted to the CI, you can create new projects by yourself without additional approval.

Keep in mind however, that any new project you make needs to follow our [Usage Guidelines](../usage-guidelines.md) and that failing to do so may result in punishments outlined [here](../usage-guidelines.md#punishments).
