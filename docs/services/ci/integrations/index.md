# Setup Git Integration
CodeMC automatically links with any Git provider upon initial acceptance of your project. In addition to this, CodeMC automatically configures your project to be polled over SCM every 15 minutes.

If you're using a specific provider, you can navigate through this section to link with your specific Source Control Management provider for additional features, such as building on a commit basis or reporting CI status. Otherwise, no additonal setup is required.
