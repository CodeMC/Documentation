# Creating a Maven Job
This page explains you step by step how to create a Build job on CodeMC for a Maven Project.  
For how to add a Gradle project, check the [Creating a Gradle Job page](../gradle).

## Creating the Job

!!! warning "Important"
    In order to create a job will you need to be added to the Site first, if you haven't already.  
    To get added, join the [Discord Server][Discord] and follow the instructions in the `#info` channel.

1. Go to https://ci.codemc.io/job/:user/newJob (Replace `:user` with your user/organisation name)
2. Enter the job name in the top text box, and select `Maven project`. Click the `OK` button at the bottom of the page.
3. Your job is now created! You should be redirected to the configuration page.

## Configuration
Here are some recommendet configuration settings to set.

### SCM

1. In the `Source Code Management` (SCM) section, click on the `git` radio button.
2. Click on `Add repository` and paste your repository URL in the corresponding text field.
3. If you want to build only a specific branch, can you define it in the `Branch Specifier` field.

### Build Trigger (Optional)
Note that you can configure CodeMC to automatically build each time you push changes to GitHub.  
A tutorial for this can be found [here](../github-integration#automatically-build).

1. Click on `Poll SCM`
2. Put `*/5 * * * *` in the large text field, to make CodeMC check your GitHub project every 5 minutes.

### Build Environment (Optional)
It's recommended to enable `Add timestamps to the Console Output`

### Build

!!! warning "Important"
    In order to build a maven project using JDK 8 you will have to use a [workaround](https://github.com/CodeMC/Documentation/blob/master/docs/faq.md#how-to-build-a-jdk-8-maven-project)

1. Write the path to your pom.xml in the `Root POM` field.
2. In the `Goals and options` field, set your default maven goals.
    - If you want to deploy the artifacts to the CodeMC repository will you need to follow the steps explained in the [FAQ](../../faq#how-can-i-deploy-my-maven-artefacts-to-the-codemc-repository)

### Post-build Actions

1. Click on the `Add post-build action` button.
2. Select `Archive the artifacts`.
3. In `Files to archive` put `target/*.jar` (default build directory) or `**/target/*.jar` for multi-module projects.
4. Click on the `Advanced` button and set `**/target/original-*.jar` in the `Exclusions` field.

## Finishing

1. Click the `Save` button. All changes will now be saved and applied and you will be redirected to your job's page.
2. To launch your first build, click the `Build Now` button on the left side.
3. CodeMC will now queue a build job and execute it. If you want to see the console of it, click on the rotating icon next to the build number under the `Build History` section.
